I'm Shirin and I'm a bioinformatician currently working on Next-Generation-Sequencing analysis of autoinflammatory diseases as part of the [AID-NET consortium](http://campus.uni-muenster.de/immunologie/forschung/aid-net/).

Obviously, I am interested in genetics and genomics but I enjoy playing around with data of all sorts. It's amazing to me what can be learned from analyzing and visualizing data!

My tool of choice for data analysis so far has been R.

I created the R package [exprAnalysis](https://github.com/ShirinG/exprAnalysis), designed to streamline my RNA-seq data analysis pipeline. It is available via Github. Instructions for installation and usage can be found [here](https://shiring.github.io/rna-seq/microarray/2016/09/28/exprAnalysis).

This blog will showcase some of the analyses I have been doing with different data sets (all freely available). I will also host teaching materials for students to access in conjunction with R courses I am giving.
